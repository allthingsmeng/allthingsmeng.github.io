My first official chalk job was with Southpaw BBQ and Southern Cooking back in 2013. I came in one night and tried to order some specials off the huge chalkboard hanging above their kitchen. When they said they didn’t carry it anymore, I jokingly poked, “Then why is it still up there!” They told me that their chalk person just moved away and that they were looking for a new one. I gave a lil peep that I may be able to help and boom—history. I’ve been hooked ever since!
