BAYCAT is an extremely active nonprofit that focuses on youth education and empowerment through creative outlets especially with digital media. I was a graphic design intern there years ago and have made long lasting connections that they've often hired me back for projects.

Using the footage that interns have shot the previous week, I along with other students, we individually edited our own pieces to potentially be for Rickshaw Bagwork's promo - and mine was chosen!
