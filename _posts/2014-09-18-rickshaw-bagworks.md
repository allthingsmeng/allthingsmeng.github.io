<a href="http://baycat.org" target="blank">BAYCAT</a> is an extremely active nonprofit that focuses on youth education and empowerment through creative outlets, especially with digital media. I was a graphic design intern there back in 2009 and have made long lasting connections that they've often hired me back for projects.

Using the footage that interns have shot the previous week, I along with other students, edited our own pieces to potentially be for Rickshaw Bagwork's promo - and mine was chosen!
