As a personal project to learn Sencha Animator, I gave myself an objective to create something that was interactive and animated. I looked through old drawings for inspiration and went straight towards a cat related thing, naturally.

My undying love for cats is no match for my allergies but this is a good alternative for others who shouldn't pet things. <a href="http://justpet.me" target="_blank">Justpet.me</a> can be saved onto your iPhone homescreen via Safari for safe keeping :)
