I was brought to TEDP to be their Social Media / Media Communications Specialist but contributed more than my job title because of my background in design. I took on the role of rebranding TEDP by providing a clean new look to their logo, taking advantage of Squarespace for their website, and updating photos - including the board members on staff.
