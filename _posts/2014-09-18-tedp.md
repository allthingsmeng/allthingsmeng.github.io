I was brought to <a href="http://tedpsf.org" target="_blank">TEDP</a> to be their Social Media &#47; Media Communications Specialist but contributed more than my job title because of my background in design. I took on the role of rebranding TEDP by providing a clean new look to their logo, taking advantage of Squarespace for their website, and updating photos &mdash; including the board members on staff.
