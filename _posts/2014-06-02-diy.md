When I found out about <a href="http://diy.org" target="_blank">DIY</a>, an online equivalent kid scout where anyone can look up tutorials to learn a skill, earn badges (virtually & physically!), and share their masterpieces - I was ecstatic. So much so that I wanted to create something of my own. Since they already had a fun logo, I wanted to make an animated gif out of it.

I showed the DIY team and they loved it. They requested an inverted version to put it as the opening screen to log into their mobile app!
